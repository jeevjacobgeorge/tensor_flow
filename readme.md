# Image Classification with Drag-and-Drop using TensorFlow.js

This project demonstrates how to implement drag-and-drop functionality for uploading images and perform image classification using a pre-trained model in TensorFlow.js. The model used here is MobileNet v1 (0.25 alpha), which is capable of classifying images into various categories.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Upload:** Easily upload images by dragging them onto the designated drop area.
- **Image Classification:** Utilizes TensorFlow.js to preprocess uploaded images and make predictions using MobileNet v1.
- **Display Predictions:** Shows top predictions for the uploaded image based on the pre-trained model.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in a web browser:** Since this project uses client-side JavaScript and TensorFlow.js, you can run it directly by opening `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

3. **Dependencies:**
   - TensorFlow.js: Included via CDN (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs`).

## Usage

1. **Upload an Image:**
   - Drag an image file onto the designated drop area (`dropContainer`).
   - Alternatively, click on the `uploadedImage` input to select an image file from your device.

2. **Prediction Display:**
   - After uploading an image, the model predicts the top categories for that image.
   - Predictions are displayed with their corresponding probabilities in the `result` section.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the structure and JavaScript integration.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file responsible for drag-and-drop functionality, image handling, and TensorFlow.js integration.
- `style.css`: CSS file for basic styling of the drop area and result section.

## Known Issues

- Currently, the top predictions display (`displayPredictions` function) is commented out. Uncomment and adapt this function to display predictions as desired.
