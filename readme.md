# Image Classification with Drag-and-Drop using TensorFlow.js

This project demonstrates drag-and-drop functionality for uploading images and performing image classification using a pre-trained MobileNet v1 model in TensorFlow.js. The uploaded image is processed and predictions are displayed in a bar chart showing the top categories.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Upload:** Upload images by dragging them onto the designated drop area (`dropContainer`).
- **Image Classification:** Utilizes TensorFlow.js to preprocess uploaded images and make predictions using MobileNet v1.
- **Prediction Visualization:** Displays predictions as a bar chart with probabilities for the top categories.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in a web browser:** This project runs entirely in the client-side environment, so you can view and interact with it by opening `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

3. **Dependencies:**
   - TensorFlow.js: Included via CDN (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs`).

## Usage

1. **Upload an Image:**
   - Click on the drop area (`dropContainer`) to select an image file from your device, or drag an image file onto the drop area directly.

2. **View Predictions:**
   - Once an image is uploaded, the model predicts the top categories for the image.
   - Predictions are displayed in a bar chart (`canvas`) with labels and corresponding probabilities.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the structure and JavaScript integration.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file responsible for drag-and-drop functionality, image handling, TensorFlow.js integration, and chart visualization.
- `style.css`: CSS file for basic styling of the drop area and result visualization.

## Code Details

- **Loading Model:** The MobileNet v1 model is loaded asynchronously from TensorFlow Hub using `tf.loadLayersModel`.
- **Preprocessing:** Images are resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized to fit the model's input requirements (`preprocessImage` function).
- **Prediction Handling:** Predictions are computed using the loaded model and displayed as a bar chart (`createBarChart` function).
- **Chart Updates:** If predictions change, the chart is updated dynamically to reflect the new data without reloading.

## Class Labels

- **ImageNet Classes:** The predictions are based on the ImageNet dataset, with class labels defined in the code (`classLabels`).
